		** Mortals **
		Duelists (Steela) - After conquering the native tribes of the mainland, the Duelist Guild forged a nation from gold and steel, naming it Fera. In fear of the natives' tribal sorcery, the Duelists outlawed all forms of magic and relentlessly hunted down its remaining practitioners. The Duelists' strict laws and philosophy molds disciplined and deadly soldiers, but antagonizes the free-spirited Assassins and Raiders.
		
		Raiders (Freeport)
		A self-proclaimed nation of exiles and magicians, the Raiders of Eastsea survive by pillaging the coasts of Fera. A Raider's versatile array of weapons and spells makes them a deadly opponent against even the most skilled Duelists. After all, one day, the Duelists will cross Eastsea to crush the Raider colony of Freeport, and the Raiders must be ready to defend their home.
		
		Assassins (Levi) - The Assassins are a secretive faction of Ferran separatists, composed of civilians, soldiers, and politicians from the city of Levi. They are slowly prying control over their home city, Levi, from the Duelists. Despite strained relations with the warring Duelists and Raiders, the Assassins occasionally carry out tasks for both sides - depending on the highest bidder.
		
		** Celestials**
		Guardians (Blood Gardens) - When the Duelists conquered Fera, the natives of the Blood Gardens peacefully surrendered in exchange for their lands and solitude. The Guardians prophesied a great war between the forces of light and dark - and the Duelists, despite all their folly, were far from evil. The Guardians tirelessly prepare for their final battle, knowing the wars around them only feed a far more sinister force.
		
		Witherknights (Umber) -	Millenia ago, the Witherknights ruled the depths of the Nether, the skies of the Aether, and every land inbetween. Their wild dark magics sprouted purple flames in Umber, and their empire crumbled in a violet blaze. After the ashes settled, the Witherknights were slowly lost to history. But now, ancient magics stir, and the Witherknights have awakened once more.
		
		Paladins (Aether Aerie) - Legends say the goddess Arda breathed life into the world, and she handpicked her most perfect creations, the Paladins, to lead it. In time, the greatest Paladins grew discontent with their eternal servitude and pitiful share of Arda's power. Thus, the first Witherknights slaughtered their own brethren to extinction and overthrew their slaver goddess. Yet Arda's spirit lives on, and she builds her power, waiting for her absolute revenge.
