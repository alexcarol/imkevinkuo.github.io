Welcome to my new site! 

My old website was originally a 'mini-resume' for showing off animations and linking to my other projects, but was overall really bland. This new site will be less animation-heavy and a bit more professional-looking! I think the red-gold-black-white color scheme goes well with my profile picture. Maybe matching the color scheme to my shirt is key to making everything mesh, but we'll see if that's true the next time I upload a new picture. 

I'm also going to start a blog now! I'll mostly write about whimsical computer-science-related things.

Jekyll is an obvious choice for blogging on Github Pages, but installing on Ruby on Windows isn't officially supported. Normally, I would chug through all the installations required and hope everything works out, but since this site's in it for the long haul, I can afford to implement blog posts from scratch. I'm manually inserting this first blog post into the HTML, but later on I'll make a Python script that automates this.
